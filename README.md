# Happy Sad Image Classification

## Introduction
This project aims to classify images into two categories: "Happy" and "Sad". It utilizes a deep learning model implemented with TensorFlow to achieve this classification task.

## Preprocess Data
The data is preprocessed by scaling it and splitting it into training, validation, and test sets.

## Deep Model
A deep learning model is built using TensorFlow. It consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, a flatten layer, and densely connected layers. The model is trained using the training data and evaluated using the validation data.

Obs: Epoch=6 due lack of RAM and process power in local machine

## Evaluate Performance
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. Additionally, the model is tested with sample images to demonstrate its functionality.

## Save Model
Finally, the trained model is saved for future use.

## Conclusion
This README provides an overview of the "Happy Sad Image Classification" project, demonstrating the process of loading, preprocessing, building, training, evaluating, testing, and saving a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow.
